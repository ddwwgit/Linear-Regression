# Linear Regression with Python

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that breaks down the implementation of linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predictive analysis. The notebook walks through the process from conceptual understanding to practical application, using a dataset that illustrates how the population of a city affects the profits of a restaurant chain.

## Contents

- `C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb`: The primary Jupyter notebook with step-by-step instructions and code cells for executing linear regression.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used in the analysis.
- `images/`: Directory containing any images or figures generated by the notebook.


### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib (for plotting)

## Usage
Navigate to the C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb notebook within the Jupyter interface in your web browser and run the cells sequentially to understand how linear regression is implemented and used.

Feel free to modify the code and use the notebook as a starting point for your own.
